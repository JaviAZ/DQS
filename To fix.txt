1) When you open the program and select "ADMIN" and then "VIEW TUTORS", only the names of the tutors are shown. This means when "Remove Tutor" is selected, you can't see the ID of the tutor you want to remove.

2) When the admin goes and selects "Add Tutor" or "Add Student", there is no way to get out of the creation process, the admin must make the tutor or student fully in otder to exit the process.

3) When the "Edit Tutor" option is selected, the ID of the tutor cannot be changed.

4) When you open the program and select "TUTOR" and then enter a surname e.g. Marshall, the following prompt asks you to enter the tutor ID number of the tutor you would like to proceed with. At this point the user can enter the tutor ID of any tutor and it will display the group for the tutor with the matching ID. Not restricted to the tutors that are shown on screen with the surnames.

5) viewTutorGroup which is found in tuteesMeth.py is used in the tutee() method to display the list of tutees and also in the tutor() method. However, it reads "The other members of your tutor group are:" which doesn't make sense if it's used in the tutor() method.
